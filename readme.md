Create bookmarklets that open multiple urls.

This is just a learning exercise where I try out [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/)

It works: After inputting two or more urls, the bottom right FAB will appear with the bookmarklet, and can be bookmarked my dragging it onto the bookmark toolbar or otherwise, and will open all those urls upon usage. But it is also very unpolished. I don't intend to continue working on it.
